## 🧑🏽‍💻 About Me

👋 Hello! I'm Hossam, an aspiring data analyst. During my accounting studies, I developed a passion for deriving insights from data, propelling me into the world of data analytics. Excited to leverage my analytical skills in tools like Python and visualization, I aim to inform data-driven decisions for organizations.

📚 post-graduation, my role as a technical support agent in the telecommunications industry provided valuable experience. Surpassing targets, I achieved a **71% customer satisfaction rate**and beat the 9:07 minutes target call time with an **8:36 minutes average**. This honed my ability to concisely explain complex technical issues—a skill I'm eager to apply as a data analyst.

💻 Ready to transition my expertise, I seek a role where I can continuously learn, connect with others, and contribute to optimizing operations through data and analytics.
